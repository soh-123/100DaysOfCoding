# Turtle Race

This is a simple Turtle Race program implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The program allows users to place bets on the winning turtle color and simulates a race among six turtles. The turtle that reaches the finish line first determines the outcome of the bet.

## Getting Started

To run the program, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and execute the Python script. The program will prompt you to enter a color to place your bet on.

```bash
python turtle_race.py
```

## Gameplay

- The race consists of six turtles, each represented by a different color.
- Use the input prompt to enter the color you want to bet on.
- After entering your bet, the race will begin.
- The turtles move forward randomly each turn.
- The first turtle to reach the right edge of the screen wins.
- If your bet matches the winning color, you win the bet.
- The program will display a message indicating whether you won or lost.

## Dependencies

This program requires the following Python modules:

- turtle: A graphics library used for creating the race animation.
- random: Used for generating random movements of the turtles.

You can install the turtle module using pip:

```bash
pip install python-turtle
```
