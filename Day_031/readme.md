# Flash Cards
The Flash Cards project is a Python application designed to help users review difficult words using the flashcards learning method. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can practice vocabulary by flipping through virtual flashcards and testing their knowledge of word translations.

## Dataset Format
The flashcards utilize a CSV file (words_to_learn.csv) as the dataset for word review. The file should have two columns: "French" and "English". Ensure that your dataset file follows this format for accurate word translations.

## Acknowledgments
The Flash Cards project was developed as a tool for individuals to practice and improve their vocabulary skills. It draws inspiration from the flashcards learning method and leverages the capabilities of the tkinter library for building the graphical user interface.

Feel free to customize and enhance the Flash Cards application to suit your needs. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

Enjoy reviewing your difficult words using this interactive Flash Cards application!
