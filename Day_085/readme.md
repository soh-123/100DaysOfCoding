# Typing Speed Test

The Typing Speed Test is a simple Python program that allows users to measure their typing speed in words per minute (WPM). It provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter the displayed text, and the program will track their speed and accuracy.

## Features

- **Countdown timer:** The program starts with a countdown timer of 60 seconds, during which users need to type as many words as they can.
- **Real-time feedback:** As the user types, the program highlights the entered text in green if it matches the displayed text, and in red if there are any errors.
- **Mistake tracking:** The program keeps track of the number of mistakes made by the user.
Word per minute (WPM) calculation: Once the time is up, the program calculates the user's typing speed in WPM based on the number of characters typed.
- **High score record:** The program maintains a high score record, storing the highest achieved WPM. It displays the high score for reference.
Restart functionality: Users can restart the typing speed test at any time to begin a new session.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install the required dependencies, if any (specified in the project's requirements.txt file).
