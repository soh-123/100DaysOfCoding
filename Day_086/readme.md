# Breakout Game

This is a classic Breakout game implemented using Python's turtle module. The game features a paddle that the player controls to bounce a ball and break bricks on the screen. The goal is to break all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen.

## Game Features:
- Control the paddle using the left and right arrow keys.
- Break bricks by bouncing the ball off the paddle and hitting the bricks.
- The ball bounces off the walls, paddle, and bricks.
- Keep track of your score, highest score, and remaining lives.
- The highest score is saved in a file (highestScore.txt) and updated if a new high score is achieved.
- Pause the game by pressing the spacebar.

## Dependencies:
The game requires the Python programming language and the turtle module, which is included in the Python standard library. No additional dependencies or installations are needed.
