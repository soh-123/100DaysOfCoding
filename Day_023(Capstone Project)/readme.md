# Turtle Crossing Game
The Turtle Crossing Game is a Python implementation of a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a turtle and tries to cross a busy road without getting hit by cars. The objective of the game is to accumulate points by successfully crossing the road and avoiding collisions with cars.
## Gameplay
- The game starts with the turtle positioned at the bottom of the screen.
- The player can use the "Up" arrow key to move the turtle vertically upward.
- Cars continuously move horizontally across the screen from right to left.
- The player must navigate the turtle safely between the cars and reach the top of the screen to score points.
- If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends, and the player receives a game over message.
- Each successful crossing increases the player's level, making the game more challenging by increasing the speed of the cars.
## Features
- Smooth animation and real-time updates using the turtle module.
- User-controlled turtle movement using keyboard input.
- Car generation and movement with increasing speed.
- Collision detection between the turtle and cars.
- Score tracking and level progression.
## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the game:

- Python 3.x
- turtle module
