# Higher Lower Game
This is a Python implementation of the Higher Lower game. The program presents the player with two options and asks them to guess which option has more followers on a social media platform. The player earns a point for each correct guess and the game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess.

## How to Play
- Run the program.
- Two options will be displayed, along with their descriptions and countries.
- Guess which option has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.
- If your guess is correct, you earn a point and the game continues with new options.
- If your guess is incorrect, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
## Features
- Random selection of options from a pre-defined list.
- Display of option names, descriptions, and countries.
- Comparison of follower counts to determine the correct guess.
- Scoring system to track the player's points.
- Clearing the screen after each guess for a better user experience.
  
## Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the data list in the game_data module. Each option should be a dictionary with the following keys: 'name', 'description', 'country', and 'follower_count'.
