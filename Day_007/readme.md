# Hangman Game
This is a Python implementation of the classic game "Hangman." The program randomly selects a word from a pre-defined list and challenges the player to guess the word by guessing individual letters. The player has a limited number of lives, and with each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's gallows is drawn. The objective is to guess the word before running out of lives.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
## Features
- Random selection of words from a pre-defined word list.
- Display of the hangman's gallows as incorrect letters are guessed.
- Tracking of remaining lives.
- Feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Win or lose message at the end of the game.

## Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the word list or adding more stages to the stages list in the hangman_art module.
