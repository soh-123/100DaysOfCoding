# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game features a snake that moves around the screen and tries to eat food items while avoiding colliding with the walls or its own tail.

## Getting Started

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and execute the Python script. The game window will open, and you can use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

## Gameplay

- The snake starts in the center of the screen and moves continuously.
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change the snake's direction.
- The objective is to eat as much food as possible to increase your score.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the score increases.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.
- After the game ends, you can restart by closing the window and running the script again.

## Dependencies

This game requires the following Python modules:

- turtle: A graphics library used for creating the game window and drawing objects.
- time: Used for controlling the game speed.

You can install these dependencies using pip:
