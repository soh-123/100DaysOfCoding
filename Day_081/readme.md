# Morse Code translator
The Morse Code Translator project is a small Python program that allows users to convert any text into Morse code. Morse code is a system of representing letters and numbers using a combination of dots (·) and dashes (−). This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to enter their desired text and receive the corresponding Morse code translation.

## Morse Code Dictionary
The Morse code dictionary used in this program includes mappings for all lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and a space (/). The dictionary ensures accurate translation from text to Morse code.

## Acknowledgments
The Morse Code Translator project was developed as a fun exercise to practice Python programming and data mapping. It draws inspiration from the classic Morse code communication system and various online resources on Morse code translations.

Feel free to customize and enhance the Morse code translator according to your preferences. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

Enjoy translating your text into Morse code using this Python program!
