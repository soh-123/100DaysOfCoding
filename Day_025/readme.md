# Multiple Python Projects for Data analysis

This repository contains multiple Python projects that demonstrate various concepts and techniques. Each project focuses on a specific topic and showcases the implementation of Python code to solve different problems.

## Project 1: Weather Data Analysis
File: `weather_data.py`

This project involves analyzing weather data stored in a CSV file. It demonstrates reading data from a file, processing it, and extracting relevant information. The project uses both basic file reading techniques and the Pandas library for data manipulation.

## Project 2: U.S. States Game
File: `us_states_game.py`

This project is a simple game that tests your knowledge of U.S. states. It utilizes the Turtle graphics library to display a map of the United States and prompts the user to guess the names of the states. The project incorporates data from a CSV file to retrieve the state names and their coordinates.

## Project 3: Squirrel Count in Central Park
File: `squirrel_count.py`

This project involves analyzing data about squirrel populations in Central Park. It utilizes the Pandas library to read a CSV file containing information about squirrel fur colors. The project calculates the count of squirrels for each fur color and saves the results in a new CSV file.

## Dependencies

- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. Install it using `pip install pandas`.
- Turtle: Used for graphics and visualization. It is a built-in library in Python.
